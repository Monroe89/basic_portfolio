            <p class="aboutme" id="aboutme1">
                I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas where I graduated from Alamo Heights High School. After high school I attended Texas Tech University where I graduated with a bachelors degree in Restaurant, Hotel, and Institutional Management! After graduation I worked in management with Enterprise Rent-A-Car for a few years before deciding to move into the technology field.

                The technology field has always been extremely exciting for me. From video games to computer programs to digital media, it has always been a huge passion of mine. While I make my move into the technology field it's extremely important for me to create and begin to build a portfolio that shows my aptitude and excitement for development and design!
