            <p class="aboutme" id="aboutme1">
                I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas where I graduated from Alamo Heights High School. After high school I attended
                Texas Tech University where I graduated with a bachelors degree in Restaurant, Hotel, and Institutional Management!
                After graduation I worked in management with Enterprise Rent-A-Car for a few years before deciding to move
                into the technology field.
            </p>

            <p class="aboutme" id="aboutme2">
                The technology field has always been extremely exciting for me. From video games to computer programs to digital media, it
                has always been a huge passion of mine. While I make my move into the technology field it's extremely important
                for me to create and begin to build a portfolio that shows my aptitude and excitement for development and
                design!
